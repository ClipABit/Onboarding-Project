# Onboarding Project
Welcome to the ClipABit team!

As part of your onboarding, we want to make sure you are familiar with the software development lifecycle and caught up on the basics of building software in a team. This includes working with Git, writing Python code, testing, and submitting a PR. By the end of this task, you should be refreshed/taught all foundational software skills you will need to be a contributing member to the team.
